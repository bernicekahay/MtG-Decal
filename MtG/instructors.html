MtG has permeated my life since I started playing in 2003, helping me to grow as a scientist and scholar and ultimately shaping who I am today. It's my desire to share as much of that joy and growth as I can through this DeCal.</div>

In Magic, I prefer to play Booster Draft as well as Elder Dragon Highlander, known also as Commander, with my pet deck, Karador, Ghost Chieftain. I love this game for its fantasy flavor as well as its insane strategical depth, and love coming up with new combos for value. Outside of Magic, I also love dancing with AFX, working as the Service Officer for HKN, and socializing! If you have any questions or just want to chill, I'm down!</div>

I started playing Magic during the Return to Ravnica block and got completely hooked playing the Esper Nephalia Drownyard deck for Standard. Since, I have been playing the game competitively and even top 8'd at a Grand Prix (I had three whole pro points once!) I'm more into playing the limited formats, although I do have legacy. I'm looking forward to learning, sharing, and growing all my knowledge and love of the game with you guys! It's going to be a MAGICal semester.
